### ðŸ§  Writeup

The challenge is named after **Matryoshka dolls**, where each doll hides another within â€” hinting that the file may contain recursively embedded data. We begin with basic inspection:

```bash
$ file dolls.jpg 
dolls.jpg: PNG image data, 594 x 1104, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
````

Next, we run `binwalk` to identify any hidden content:

```bash
$ binwalk dolls.jpg

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             PNG image, 594 x 1104, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
3226          0xC9A           TIFF image data, big-endian, offset of first image directory: 8
272492        0x4286C         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 378952, uncompressed size: 383937, name: base_images/2_c.jpg
651610        0x9F15A         End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```

We extract the embedded files:

```bash
$ binwalk -e dolls.jpg
```

A zip file (`4286C.zip`) is extracted. Exploring the extracted contents:

```bash
$ cd _dolls.jpg.extracted/base_images/
$ file 2_c.jpg
2_c.jpg: PNG image data...
```

We repeat `binwalk` on the next image:

```bash
$ binwalk -e 2_c.jpg
```

This process continues â€” each image contains another zip or image file:

* `2_c.jpg` â†’ `3_c.jpg`
* `3_c.jpg` â†’ `4_c.jpg`
* `4_c.jpg` â†’ `flag.txt`

Once fully extracted, we finally find the flag:

```bash
$ cat flag.txt
picoCTF{96fac089316e094d41ea046900197662}
```

âœ… **Flag:** `picoCTF{96fac089316e094d41ea046900197662}`

```
